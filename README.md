## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Choices & Rationale

| Technology         | Why?                                                                                   |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SQLite3**        | Simple, zero-config database for development and testing.                             |
| **Hotwire (Turbo & Stimulus)** | Turbo offers preloading and efficient page updates out of the box so seems like an evident choice for Rails 7. |
| **Tailwind CSS**   | I am a tailwindcss big fan and the auto-generated styling offers a very good starting point. |
| **Importmap**      | Modern JS management without Node bundling, keeping the stack simple.                 |
| **Capybara & Selenium** | System/browser testing for end-to-end feature coverage.                          |

## Further more

I have a "postgresql version" of this project locally with action_text set with Trix for task list description field. This can be a good enhancement for the current project.
Steps:
- Install and configure Active Storage and Action Text:
```sh
    bin/rails active_storage:install
```
```sh
    bin/rails action_text:install
```
- Migrate database:
```sh
    bin/rails db:migrate
```
- Add this line to `app/models/task_list.rb`:
```rb
    has_rich_text :content
```
- Replace basic text_area form helper to `rich_text_area`
- Update description display
